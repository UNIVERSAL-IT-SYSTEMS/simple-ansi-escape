simple-ansi-escape
==================

This is a simple PHP function called ansi_esc() that uses short sequences to be able to quickly and intuitively use ANSI escape codes (color, bold) in php-cli scripts.

Included with it, is a function ansi_esc_test() and an additional file test.php to help you get started.

 1) Supports most standard ANSI Escape Codes and some non-standard ones
 2) Does not support xterm-256 extensions, but it could be added
 3) Tries to be intuitive, and correct you where possible, and allow for flexible syntax so "it just feels right"

It has no other documentation other than the comments in the code and the code itself.

The code is licensed under the BSD license.
